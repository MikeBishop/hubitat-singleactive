# Single Active Switch for Hubitat

Inspired by [this
thread](https://community.hubitat.com/t/simple-rule-machine-rule-controlling-multiple-switches/123845),
this is a port of a driver used in [Palette
Scenes](https://community.hubitat.com/t/beta-palette-scenes/106335)
to a stand-alone app.

It's very simple -- select multiple switches, and only one of them can be on
at once. If one turns on, the others get turned off.
